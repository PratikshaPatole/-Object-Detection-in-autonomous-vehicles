Problem Statement:
Non-autonomous vehicles have been around for a while, and according to an online study, the percentage of accidents caused by human error is very high. 

Every year, almost 1.3 million people die in road accidents around the world, an average of 3,287 deaths per day. When it comes to USA, the number of people killed in road accidents in 2013 alone was 1,00,060. 

The root causes of these injuries are talking on the phone, driving while intoxicated, and violating traffic laws, and the numbers are steadily increasing, posing a serious threat. No matter how hard we try to raise awareness about traffic rules and the importance of maintaining a healthy driving environment, incidents continue to occur without warning. 

Human mistakes can never be completely removed, but injuries should be avoided. And in this situation, technology has unquestionably saved the day. The development and enhancement of this technology has seen an exponential growth in recent years, starting from the very early radar based collision detection to today's technology. Self-driving vehicles are one of the most talked-about technologies in the modern era.
